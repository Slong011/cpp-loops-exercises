# C++ Loops Practice

This repository contains examples of different types of loops in C++, practicing fundamental programming concepts.

## Included Examples

- **For Loops**  
  Demonstrates basic usage of `for` loops, including counting and iterating through ranges.

- **While Loops**  
  Illustrates how `while` loops can be used for conditional repetition and input validation.

- **Nested Loops**  
  Explores nested loop structures for creating patterns, grids, and solving more complex problems.

## How to Use
This project uses the CTurtle library for graphics, which must be installed or included to compile and run the code.
Clone the repository and run the `.cpp` files in your preferred C++ compiler.
